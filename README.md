### Project Description

Pizza Hub is an interactive online pizza ordering platform that enables users to search, filter, and browse pizzas, manage their orders in a dynamic basket, and securely complete purchases through a seamless checkout process.

### Features

**1. User Authentication:**

- **Sign-up modal:** Allows new users to register by entering their username, email, password, and mobile number.

- **Login modal:** Allows existing users to log in by entering their username, password, and an optional credit amount.

**2. Search and Filter:**

- A search bar and filter options (e.g., price sorting from low to high or high to low) allows users to search for specific pizzas or filter them based on certain criteria.

**3. Order Management:**

- **Basket:** Users can view their current basket, showing the number of items and the total cost. There is a basket modal where users can review their order details, see the total amount, and proceed to checkout.

- **Checkout:** Users can view the total amount to be paid and the available credit. They can proceed with the payment via the checkout modal.

**4. Responsive Design:**

- The page is responsive, with styling to provide a consistent look across various screen sizes from mobile through to desktop.

**5. Interactive Elements:**

- Modals for signup, login, and checkout provides a dynamic user experience.

- FontAwesome icons enhances the visual appeal and usability of the application as well as custom design provided by UI/UX developers.
